> This document is a draft for discussion and still a work in progress. To contribute, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/governance/pulls). Major changes will be discussed in the comment section.

### Overview

[Unitex/GramLab][unitex] is an open source, cross-platform, multilingual, lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite.

### License

* Core (Unitex) and IDE (GramLab) components are distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 [LGPLv2][LGPLv2], which itself incorporates the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License.

* Linguistic Resources are distributed under the terms of the Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources [LGPL-LR][LGPL-LR].

* Unitex/GramLab includes copyrighted third-party libraries licensed either under the terms of the Apache Software License Version 1.1, or  under the terms of the [BSD 2-Clause][BSD-2-Clause] License ("BSD License"). All  third-party packages are copyright by their respective authors.

### Roles And Responsibilities

Unitex/GramLab development is based on user consensus and open discussion between users. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place.

#### Unitex/GramLab users

Unitex/GramLab users are community members who have a need for the project. Through their usage, they give the project a purpose. Members are encouraged to participate in the project life by providing feedback on how their needs are satisfied.

Users activities include, but are not limited to:

* Evangelisation and advocating for the project.
* Informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective both through the [Unitex/GramLab forum][forum] or following the [Bug Reporting Guide][bugs].
* Providing moral support, a 'thank you' goes a long way.
* Writing [tutorials][tutorials].

#### Unitex/GramLab Contributors

Unitex/GramLab contributors are users contributing in concrete ways to the project. Contribution may be a one time participation or occur over time. Contribution can take place in many ways:

##### Linguistic Resources Contributors
[LR-contributor]

* Contribute new linguistic Resources and help maintain existing ones.

###### Become a Linguistic Resources Contributor

##### Coding Contributors
[DEV-Contributor]

* Submit patches to fix bugs or add features.
* Identifying requirements.

###### Become a Coding Contributor

The [documentation for developers](https://github.com//UnitexGramLab/unitex-doc-devel) is a good place to start getting familiar with the coding style and documentation guidelines. We invite contributors to share their feature development and patch idea through the [developer mailing list][devel] or the [users forum][forum]. It is recommended to start with small patches and share your code early so the community can provide feedback and guidance.

##### Non-Coding Contributors

[Non-code contributions](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/non-coding-contributors-in-open-source) ([Contributor]) are incredibly valuable and very welcome,  Here are some examples of simple ways to contribute:

* Writing and maintaining the documentation.
* Participate in the community's activities.

###### Become a Non-Coding Contributor

#### Unitex/GramLab Commiters

Unitex/GramLab Committers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project, have a deep understanding of the code base and project strategy and work well with contributors and users. Committers have no more authorities than contributors, and they should engage with the community through the [developer mailing list][devel] or the [users forum][forum] regarding their intention. However committers have earn enough trust from the community to have direct access to the project code base without having to submit pull request. Committers seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before. Therefor committers

* Help contributors via the [developer mailing list][devel].
* Merge pull request submit by contributors.
* Have direct access to the code base.
* Nominate and vote new committers.
* Participate in the strategic planning.
* Participate in the release planning.
* Approve changes to the governance model.

###### Become a Commiter

You need to start being a Unitex/GramLab Contributor and be then be nominated as a committer. Unitex/GramLab select and elect new committers using the [Apache model][newcommitter]. You may nominate yourself. Nomination should be sent to the [developer mailing list][devel].

#### Unitex/GramLab Sponsors

Unitex/GramLab Committers are ...

###  Decision Making Process 

From a practical point of view, the direction that the project takes is controlled by the contributors, not the users (unless they're contributors too). Development is made based on contributors and committers donating their time and money to the community. Unitex/GramLab use the [Apache Decision Making][makedecision] process to decide the future of the project.

#### Lazy Concensus

The [lazy consensus](http://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html) is used for most the contribution ranging from bug fixes to minor changes where the contributor assume to have the support of the community to tackle the issue.

If you are not sure to have the support of the community for a change, you can state a lazy consensus. Member of the community have then 72h to provide feedback on the proposal. 

In all cases silence is consent.

#### Consensus Building

If you feel that lazy consensus isn't appropriate for your proposal, you can explicitly request for feedback on the the [developer mailing list][devel]. [Building concensus](http://community.apache.org/committers/consensusBuilding.html) help contributors and committers to gather feedback early on and pool the interest by the community for a new feature.

Contributors are invited to express their opinion of any given feature or pull request. Support is expressed using:

| Value | Meaning                                                                                                    |
| :---: |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +1    | I agree with this and will help make it happen                                                             |
| +0.9  | This is a cool idea and i like it, but I don't have time/the skills necessary to help out                  |
| +0    | I agree with this but probably won't make it happen, so my opinion is not that important                   |
| -0    | I don't agree with this, but I'm offering no alternative so my opinion is not that important               |
| -0.9  | I really don't like this, but I'm not going to stand in the way if everyone else wants to go ahead with it |
| -1    | I don't agree and I am offering an alternative that I am able to help implement                            |

#### Open Development process

Unitex/GramLab development is based on user consensus and open discussion between users. Decision making must be done in a transparent, open fashion (ie. using discussion list and issue list). No decisions about the project's direction, bug fixes or features may be done in private without community involvement and participation. Discussions must begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community's participation is vital during the entire decision-making process.
